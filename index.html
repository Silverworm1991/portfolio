        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I used to make a living dealing with problems solving around the food industry: from organizing elements, to
            generating income and distilling team's confrontation! Since COVID my inner voice, along with my leadership
            experience with managing people, decided to play dice with fate to call me up again to grab my profissional
            career out of the restaurant business loop!

            With a little bit of INTENSE hard work I've started acquiring primarily knowledge from JavaScript and Java
            and I've been able to direct those qualities I've gathered through the years to become a programming model!

            PM me if you need any additional information or need assistance in the so called IT "Lodo"(High pressure)
            that will happen in our coders lifetime.</p>

                <h3>Superman: Fly to the Supermart</h3>
                <p>This project was initiated during the fourth week of the Code for All_ Full-Stack Programming
                    bootcamp in October. As first-time programmers working under a deadline, it was quite a challenge!
                    Our mission was to create a simple graphics game within one week. Together, we brainstormed the
                    game's aesthetic and mechanics, focusing on an obstacle-avoidance theme.</p>

                <h3>Helphub</h3>
                <p>HelpHub is a platform created to connect volunteers with elderly or disabled individuals who are
                    isolated or alone and could use a helping hand.
                    This project was our final challenge during the Code for All bootcamp, developed under a tight 3-day
                    deadline.</p>

                <h3>Mortgage Calculator</h3>
                <p>A mortgage calculator using React demonstrates functional components, state management, and user
                    input
                    handling, using Material UI for styling. It ensures modular code, a responsive interface, dynamic
                    user inputs, and efficient data flow with props and destructuring. The useState hook manages values
                    and real-time calculations, making the tool interactive and efficient.</p>
